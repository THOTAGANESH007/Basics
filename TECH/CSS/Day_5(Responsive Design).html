    <p>
      The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. To ensure your
      website is displayed correctly on different devices, you need to include
      the viewport meta tag in the <b>"head"</b> of your HTML document Why
      it's essential: Without the viewport tag, mobile browsers will render
      the page at a typical desktop screen width and then scale it down,
      making it difficult to read without zooming.
    </p>
    <p>
      width=device-width: This sets the width of the page to follow the
      screen-width of the device.
    <p> initial-scale=1.0: This sets the initial
      zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.</p>
    </p>

    <h4>2. CSS Media Queries</h4>
    <p>
      Media queries are a feature of CSS3 that allow you to apply styles based on the characteristics of the device,
      such as its width, height, or orientation. They are the cornerstone of responsive design.
      Syntax: "@media media-type and (media-feature) {
      /* CSS rules go here */
      }"
      A media query consists of a media type (e.g., screen, print) and can include one or more media features (e.g.,
      min-width, max-width,orientation).

    <h4>Mobile-First Design</h4>
    <p>In this approach, you design for the smallest screen first and then add more features and a more complex layout
      for larger screens. This is also known as progressive enhancement.
      How it's done: You write your base CSS for mobile devices and then use min-width media queries to add styles for
      tablets and desktops.
      Advantages:
      Focuses on the essential content for all users.
      Often leads to better performance on mobile devices.
      Aligns with the trend of increasing mobile internet usage.</p><br>
    <h4>Desktop-First Design</h4>
    <p>This is the traditional approach where you design for a large desktop screen and then adapt the layout for
      smaller screens. This is also called graceful degradation.
      How it's done: You write your base CSS for desktops and then use max-width media queries to simplify the layout
      for tablets and mobile devices.
      Advantages:
      Can be better suited for websites with a lot of data or complex features that are primarily used on desktops.</p>
